### D.Y.O.R - (Do Your Own Research)

We are currently building a financial insight & analytics platform for new and professional stock/bonds/crypto investors and traders. The idea behind this is to track the markets and provide real-time insights and information into the current state of stocks, bonds and crypto investments made by the users.

## Core Features
- Real-Time Market Tracking
- Portfolio Tracking & Personalization
- Hyper-Personalized AI Insights (Compliant): D.Y.O.R can differentiate itself by moving beyond generic market data to provide truly tailored insights and predictions.
- Simplified Financial Intelligence : The platform can excel at translating complex market data and sophisticated AI analysis into easily digestible updates and actionable recommendations.

## Tech Stack
- Backend : Go
- Frontend: Next js, Tanstack Router, 
- DB: Postgres/ PgLite

## Unique Value Proposition
- Cross-Asset Class Integration: Offering a single, unified platform for stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies, D.Y.O.R can provide a holistic view and comparative analytics across these diverse asset classes. 
- Hyper-Personalized AI Insights
- Unified Multi-Asset View: While some platforms offer multi-asset tracking (e.g., Delta ), few provide deep, AI-driven insights across stocks, bonds, and crypto within a single, intuitive interface that caters to both beginner and advanced users, DYOR fixes that.
- Actionable AI Predictions (Compliant): Many platforms provide raw data or basic predictions. D.Y.O.R can differentiate by offering prescriptive analytics, guiding users on what to do next based on predictions and contextual factors.
